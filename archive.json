Should this requirement be changed to say something to the effect of \"must contain scopes that don't grant permission for actions outside of the SCIM service provider\"? \n\n2. As part of SCIM-related work in IPSIE, should we try to define specific scopes or a framework for designing scopes that would scale beyond users and groups?\n\n3. \"scim\" is still pretty broad, versus something like scim.groups.read or scim.users.readwrite - definitely feels more granular than a lot of implementations have today, but if we've got a chance to raise the bar, this sort of approach might be worth including.

I'm in favor of referring to them using the existing SCIM terminology, and if necessary, we can add items to the terminology section near the beginning of the document.\n\n> first, first is aroudn SPs not needing groups. could be resolved with:\n> \n\n- > The IdP MUST support Group operations\n\n- > The SP MAY support Groups if it aligns with their use case\n\nI think the second option is the correct one. Virtually everything in SCIM is optional when it comes to the schema and what resources are supported, and not all applications have need for groups and/or roles. There's an argument that having some way for the IDP to see and/or manage entitlement grants in the application improves security posture. If I were to try to write a SCIM AL* requirement to capture that, it would probably be a requirement for the SP to support at least one of a list of methods that help to achieve that. \n\nGiven the multiple options that are available, IMO we should provide requirements that apply if the application supports one of those features. I'm not sure if we should be mandating either of them at AL1, though - would need to think about that more and discuss with a wider group. ",

Federation/SSO should be required, which means that the \"password\" attribute on the User resource shouldn't be needed. There are legacy apps that may require passwords to be synced into them, but those won't be IPSIE SL* compliant and similarly shouldn't be AL* compliant, IMO. \n\nI'm not sure if a requirement is needed or useful on the IDP side - the IDP's client/provisioning service will always support a superset of features compared to what any single application may use, and an IDP's SCIM client supporting sending the user \"password\" attribute doesn't matter if it isn't being used with the SCIM SP. I can think of some possible implementation mistakes that could lead to security issues, such as mapping IDP's user.password to any random attribute on the application's end, and then using that to discover the user's password in the IDP - but my gut is that that isn't in IPSIE's scope.",

In practice, some service providers will silently drop unsupported attributes on a POST, and others will return an error due to the inclusion of unsupported attributes. \n\n> Does this extend to extension schemas?\n> An Application could technically accept password-equivalent credential material under a custom schema namespace, and the current language wouldn\u2019t catch that.\n\n> Is the intent to prohibit only the core SCIM User.password attribute, or is the intention requirement broader i.e., prohibiting any attribute that carries credential material (hashed passwords, MFA seeds, recovery codes, etc.)?\n\nGood catch. RFC 7643 section 3.3 has a normative requirement related to this:\n`_Schema extensions SHOULD avoid redefining any attributes defined in this specification and SHOULD follow conventions defined in this specification._`\n\nThat SHOULD is a problem, as is the difference in interpretation that various people may have when it comes to whether or not an extension is redefining attributes defined in RFC 7643.  \n\nWhen I created this issue, I was thinking only of user.password, but I think there's value in determining what is allowed, and for the things that are allowed, what the rules are.  \n\nI'll add language around user.password to the current edits I'm working on, and I'll create a new issue to track the other scenarios.",

SCIM APIs usually have request rate limits that lead to SCIM clients building an outgoing message queue to avoid triggering 429 responses from the SCIM API. These queues usually operate on a FIFO (first in, first out) model, although inserting specific requests to the top of the queue is possible. For larger source directories with hundreds of thousands of users, the churn in the directory combined with any \"transient\" deactivations that may have the user go from active -> disabled -> active in the span of a few minutes could end up with the active true/false changes consuming most or all of the SCIM API's request rate allowance, keeping other changes stuck in that outgoing message queue for a while. \n\nAn example of the transient deactivation I mentioned above is: the user signs in from new location, a risk event triggers that leads them to lose access to some apps/have sign-in at the IDP blocked/etc., and then they mitigate the \"high risk\" flag via something like strong MFA.\n\nAny requirement on the AL* side should probably take the existence/use of other mechanisms to disable an account (CAEP?, OpenID Provider Commands..) since if another mechanism that can accomplish the same thing is in use requiring it with SCIM AL1 may not have any benefit, but it will increase COGS for both the SCIM client and SCIM service provider, as well as consuming the SCIM client's request allowance with the SCIM service provider.
