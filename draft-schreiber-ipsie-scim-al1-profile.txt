2.  Introduction

   This document defines the IPSIE Account Lifecycle 1 (AL1) Profile for
   SCIM 2.0.  It provides a clear reference for SCIM deployments that
   require a well-defined security baseline meeting best practices for
   interoperable enterprise identity management.

   The profile addresses critical aspects of secure identity management,
   with particular emphasis on:

   *  Client authentication
   *  Retrieve, add, and modify Users
   *  Retrieve, add, and modify Groups
   *  Synchronization of data from the Identity Service to the
      Application

   By adhering to this profile, organizations can implement SCIM-based
   integrations that meet stringent security requirements while ensuring
   interoperability across different implementations.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.1.  Terminology

   SCIM

   |  The System for Cross-domain Identity Management as defined in
   |  [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   SCIM Client

   |  An application that uses the SCIM protocol to access or manage
   |  identity data maintained by the SCIM service provider (SP).  The
   |  client initiates SCIM HTTP requests to a SCIM service provider.
   |  To clarify the relationship in terms of identity management, the
   |  Identity Provider (IdP) is the SCIM Client and initiates requests
   |  to the SP, which is the SCIM Server.

   SCIM Server (also referred to as SCIM Service Provider)

   |  An HTTP web application that provides identity information via the
   |  SCIM protocol.  To clarify the relationship in terms of identity
   |  management, the SP is the SCIM Server and receives the requests
   |  from the IdP, which is the SCIM Client.

   Role

   |  A set of permissions.  Any user or account within the same role
   |  receives the predefined ability to access a resource and/or
   |  perform an action.

   Identity Service or Identity Provider (IdP)

   |  Acts as the SCIM client, initiating all provisioning, updates, and
   |  deprovisioning operations.

   Application

   |  Acts as the SCIM server or service provider, hosting SCIM
   |  endpoints and processing all provisioning requests.

   Note: When SCIM is applied to the context of IPSIE, the Identity
   Service acts as the SCIM client and the Application acts as the SCIM
   service provider.  The document will use the Role terms below for
   consistency across IPSIE Profiles.

4.  Profile

4.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The Identity Service and Application MUST use OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] for
   authentication and authorization of SCIM protocol.

   |  *Editor's Note:* This section should be expanded and may need to
   |  reference the IPSIE Session Lifecycle 1 (SL1) profile.

   The following requirements ensure consistent and secure handling of
   access tokens and authorization server configuration:

   *  OAuth 2.0 interactions MUST use the client_credentials grant type
      with JWT Client Authentication as defined in [RFC7523] section
      2.2.
   *  The Identity Provider SHALL acquire an access token and present
      that token in the {Authorization: Bearer} header on all subsequent
      SCIM requests.
   *  The Application's OAuth 2.0 authorization server SHALL NOT support
      inclusion of client credentials in the HTTP request-body
   *  The token MUST contain a "token_endpoint" value which is the URL
      of the Identity Service's OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.
   *  The Acess Token MUST include the "scim" scope and not grant
      broader permissions.
   *  All Authorization Server parameters SHOULD be discovered from
      OAuth Authorization Server metadata as defined in [RFC8414].
   *  The Identity Service SHOULD expose a jwks_uri to allow the
      Application to perform signature verification

4.2.  SCIM Interoperability Requirements

4.2.1.  General Requirements

   *  The Identity Service SHALL implement the required functionality of
      a SCIM client as defined in [RFC7643] and [RFC7644].
   *  The Application SHALL implement the required functionality of a
      SCIM service provider as defined in [RFC7643] and [RFC7644].
   *  All SCIM operations SHALL be authenticated and authorized via
      OAuth 2.0 as specified in Section 4.1.
   *  Local modifications to Users or Groups in the Application are
      prohibited.
   *  The Application SHALL enforce rate limits on all SCIM endpoints
      and must respond with appropriate headers, such as "429 Too Many
      Requests" and "Retry-After," when limits are exceeded.
   *  The Identity Service SHALL use the HTTP PATCH method to update
      resources and SHALL NOT use the HTTP PUT method.

4.2.2.  User Provisioning

   Requirements for user provisioning operations are defined in this
   section.

4.2.2.1.  Schema

   The Application MUST include the following attributes in the User
   schema:

   *  userName
   *  displayName
   *  active

   Additionally, the "externalId" attribute defined as optional in the
   "common" resource schema in [RFC7643] MUST be supported by the
   Application.

4.2.2.2.  Passwords and other credentials

   The Application MUST NOT support the "password" attribute.

   The Identity Service MUST NOT include the "password" attribute in any
   SCIM requests.

   A user resource may have various credentials or similar data
   associated with them.  This includes passwords, password hashes,
   private keys, and multi-factor authentication data such as Time-Based
   One-Time Password (TOTP) seeds.  The Application MUST NOT define
   attributes containing credentials in custom schemas.  The Identity
   Service MUST NOT send values for user credentials in any SCIM
   requests.

   |  *DZ note* Set the credential-related requirements as aggressively
   |  restrictive for now, can define any exceptions or other rules
   |  later after discussion.

4.2.2.3.  Create User (POST /Users)

   The Identity Service and the Application MUST support user creation
   via POST /Users.

4.2.2.4.  Update User (PATCH /Users/{id})

   The Identity Service and the Application MUST support updating a
   user's attribute values via the SCIM operation PATCH /Users/{id}.

4.2.2.5.  Deactivate or Reactivate User (PATCH /Users/{id})

   Changes to the user activation status, such deactivation and
   reactivation, are performed by the SCIM operation PATCH /Users/{id}

   The Identity Service SHOULD propagate user deactivation events to the
   Application within 5 minutes of the user being deactivated.

   The Application SHOULD respond to user deactivation events by
   revoking the ability for the user to continue accessing the
   Application, including the revocation of currently active sessions.
   Session revocation mechanisms are outside the scope of this profile.
   Revocation SHOULD occur within 5 minutes of receiving the
   deactivation request.

   When a user account is deactivated, all access mechanisms and
   authorizations associated with that account MUST also be deactivated.
   This includes, but is not limited to:

   *  Web sessions
   *  API tokens
   *  Refresh tokens
   *  Personal access tokens
   *  SSH keys associated with the user
   *  Device-based authentication credentials

   The Application MUST allow reactivation of a deactivated user.

4.2.2.6.  Delete User (DELETE /Users/{id})

   Applications MAY allow users to be deleted via the SCIM operation
   DELETE /Users/{id}.

   After a user is deleted, the Application MUST allow the creation of a
   new user with the same username.

   |  *Editor's Note:* Need to clarify implications for maintaining user
   |  data and avoiding conflicts when recreating users with the same
   |  username.

4.2.2.7.  Get All Users (GET /Users)

   The Application MUST support retrieval of all users via the SCIM
   operation GET /Users.

   The Application MUST support at least one pagination method and
   SHOULD avoid returning more than 1,000 users per page.  Support for
   cursor-based pagination by the Application is RECOMMENDED.

4.2.2.8.  Get User By ID (GET /Users/{id})

   The Application MUST support retrieving a single user by ID via the
   SCIM operation GET /Users/{id}.

4.2.2.9.  List Users By Alternate Identifier (GET /Users?)

   The Application MUST support the SCIM "filter" query parameter,
   performed via the SCIM operation: GET
   /Users?filter={filterExpression}

   Application Providers MUST support the following filter expressions:

   *  username eq {username}
   *  externalId eq {externalId}
   *  emails[value eq {email}]
   *  emails[type eq "work" and value eq {email}]

4.2.3.  Group Provisioning Operations

   Requirements for group provisioning operations are defined in this
   section.  The Application MAY implement support for groups and MUST
   follow the below requirements if it does.

4.2.3.1.  Schema

   The Application MUST include the following attributes in the Group
   schema:

   *  displayName
   *  members

   Additionally, the "externalId" attribute defined as optional in the
   "common" resource schema in [RFC7643] MUST be supported by the
   Application.

   The Application SHOULD NOT allow multiple groups to have the same
   value for the "displayName" attribute".

   The Identity Service SHOULD use a unique value for the "displayName"
   attribute.

4.2.3.2.  Create Group (POST /Groups)

   The Identity Service and the Application MUST support group creation
   via POST /Groups.

   The Application MUST allow groups to be created with zero members.

4.2.3.3.  Get All Groups (GET /Groups)

   The Application MUST support retrieval of all groups via the SCIM
   operation GET /Groups.

   The Application MUST support the attributes= and excludedAttributes=
   parameters.

   The Identity Service SHOULD include excludedAttributes=members in the
   HTTP URI when listing all groups.

4.2.3.4.  Get Group By ID (GET /Group/{id})

   The Application MUST support retrieving a single group by ID via the
   SCIM operation GET /Groups/{id}.

4.2.3.5.  List Groups By Alternate Identifier (GET /Groups?)

   The Application MUST support the SCIM "filter" query parameter,
   performed via the SCIM operation: GET
   /Groups?filter={filterExpression}

   The Application MUST support the following filter expressions for
   groups:

   *  displayName eq {displayName}
   *  externalId eq {externalId}

4.2.3.6.  Update Group (PATCH /Group/{id})

   The Identity Service and the Application MUST support updating a
   group's attribute values via the SCIM operation PATCH /Groups/{id}.

   The Application MUST support the inclusion of at least 50 add or
   remove operations on the "members" attribute in a single PATCH
   request.

   The Identity Service SHOULD compile multiple changes to the "members"
   attribute into a single PATCH request.

4.3.  Metadata Endpoints

4.3.1.  ResourceTypes

   Application MUST host a /ResourceTypes endpoint, as defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC7644].

4.3.2.  ServiceProviderConfig

   Application Providers MUST host a /ServiceProviderConfig endpoint to
   describe the operations they support, as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC7644]

   The operations MUST include, at minimum, the set of SCIM capabilities
   required for compatibility with this IPSIE profile.

4.3.3.  Schemas

   Application Providers MUST host a /Schemas endpoint to describe the
   supported schemas, as defined in Section 4 of [RFC7644].  There must
   be a schema for each implemented resource type.  Schemas returned by
   the Application MUST include all implemented attributes and MUST NOT
   include attributes that are not implemented.

5.  Security Considerations

   For SCIM security considerations, see [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   Additionally, the following requirements are included to address
   security considerations.

   *  *Transport Security*: All endpoints SHALL enforce TLS 1.2 or later
      with strong cipher suites and certificate validation.
   *  *Error Handling*: Error responses SHALL use the SCIM error format
      and SHALL NOT leak internal details.
   *  *Replay Resistance*: Access tokens SHALL expire and nonces SHALL
      be validated to prevent replay.
   *  *Auditing*: All SCIM requests resulting in the creation, deletion,
      or modification of a SCIM resource SHALL be logged for audit and
      troubleshooting.
   *  *Rate Limiting*: All endpoints SHALL enforce rate limiting and
      must respond with "429 Too Many Requests" when limits are
      exceeded.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Compliance Statement

   Implementation of all mandatory requirements in this profile will
   result in a SCIM 2.0 deployment that satisfies IPSIE Identity
   Lifecycle Level 1 (IL1).  Specifically:

   *  *Identity Service (SCIM client)*

      -  SHALL initiate all CRUD operations for Users and Groups.
      -  SHALL adhere to the security considerations above.

   *  *Application (SCIM service provider)*

      -  SHALL host all SCIM endpoints with full support for User
         provisioning, and if supported, Group provisioning.
      -  SHALL prevent local modifications outside of SCIM.
      -  SHALL enforce OAuth 2.0 JWT Profile for Authentication
         [RFC7523].
      -  SHALL adhere to the security considerations above.

   By conforming to this profile, implementations will achieve a
   consistent, secure, and interoperable baseline for enterprise
   identity lifecycle management.
